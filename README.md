# Damien Nez's Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This website helps keep my notes in an easy to read space thats accessable over the internet and helps randomly choose the topic for you to learn.

I was motivated to create this project not only because of an assigment but also in the persuit of knowlege and the accomplishment of creating a website that is located in a github reposiory that is my own. I built this study guide website to get hands on experince for the rudemental web development skills I learned during the prework section of the course. While working on this project I reviewed some basic level HTML, CSS, and Git while also learning some new skills such as some JavaScript basics and what github is and how it can be used my professionals to collaborate with their team to create projects.
